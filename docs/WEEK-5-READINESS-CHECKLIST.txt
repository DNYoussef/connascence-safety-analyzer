WEEK 5 READINESS CHECKLIST - HONEST ASSESSMENT
==============================================

Date: 2025-11-13
Status: NOT READY FOR WEEK 5
Overall: FAILED - Critical blockers identified

VERIFIED METRICS (From actual test run 2025-11-13 03:37:34)
-----------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Test Suite Execution: FAILED (1 error during collection)
[ ] Test Pass Rate: 0% (collection failed, tests not run)
[ ] Coverage: 14.04% (NOT 90.2% as claimed) - FAILED
[ ] Quality Gate 4: FAILED (cannot validate - tests not running)
[ ] Production Ready: NO (blocked by test failures)

CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must fix before Week 5)
-------------------------------------------
[X] Issue #1: psutil.NoSuchProcess error
    - Location: analyzer/optimization/memory_monitor.py:241
    - Impact: Prevents all tests from running
    - Status: UNRESOLVED

[X] Issue #2: Coverage database corrupted
    - Error: "no such table: tracer" in .coverage file
    - Impact: Cannot measure coverage accurately
    - Status: UNRESOLVED

[X] Issue #3: Module import failures
    - Warning: "Module reporting was never imported"
    - Impact: Missing integration test coverage
    - Status: UNRESOLVED

COVERAGE GAPS (Actual vs Claimed)
----------------------------------
CacheManager:       8.55% actual vs 95.3% claimed (-86.75%)
StreamProcessor:    9.75% actual vs 92.1% claimed (-82.35%)
MetricsCollector:  14.20% actual vs 98.7% claimed (-84.50%)
ReportGenerator:   10.69% actual vs 87.4% claimed (-76.71%)
Overall Project:   14.04% actual vs 90.2% claimed (-76.16%)

QUALITY GATE 4 REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------
[X] Test Coverage >= 80%: FAILED (14.04%)
[ ] Critical Violations = 0: UNKNOWN (tests not running)
[ ] High Violations < 5: UNKNOWN (tests not running)
[ ] Medium Violations < 20: UNKNOWN (tests not running)
[ ] Test Pass Rate = 100%: FAILED (0%)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Priority Order)
-----------------------------------
1. [ ] Fix psutil.NoSuchProcess error (BLOCKER)
2. [ ] Rebuild coverage database (BLOCKER)
3. [ ] Resolve module import failures (BLOCKER)
4. [ ] Write tests for cache_manager (8.55% -> 80%+)
5. [ ] Write tests for stream_processor (9.75% -> 80%+)
6. [ ] Write tests for report_generator (10.69% -> 80%+)
7. [ ] Write tests for metrics_collector (14.20% -> 80%+)
8. [ ] Run full test suite to verify 100% pass
9. [ ] Verify coverage >= 80% with real measurement
10. [ ] Re-validate Quality Gate 4

WEEK 5 GO/NO-GO DECISION
-------------------------
Decision: NO-GO
Reason: Critical test failures, coverage at 14.04% vs 80% requirement
Impact: Production deployment delayed by 1 week
Action: Emergency fixes sprint required

REVISED WEEK 5 PLAN
--------------------
Day 1-2: Fix blockers (psutil, coverage DB, imports)
Day 3-4: Write missing tests to reach 80%+ coverage
Day 5: Validate all tests pass and coverage met

HONEST ASSESSMENT
-----------------
Week 4 Report: Contained aspirational metrics not verified
Week 5 Reality: Tests failing, coverage at 14%, NOT production ready
Recommendation: Fix infrastructure before claiming completion
