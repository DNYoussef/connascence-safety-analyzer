CONNASCENCE ANALYSIS\n   - Total violations detected: 0\n   - Critical violations: 0\n   - NASA compliance score: 100.0%\n   - Code duplication score: 100.0%\n\n2. SIX SIGMA QUALITY METRICS\n   - Sigma Level: 6.00\n   - DPMO: 0\n   - Quality Score: 0.00\n   - Quality Gate: PASS\n\n3. THEATER DETECTION RESULTS\n   - Claims validated: 5\n   - Legitimate claims: 2\n   - Suspicious claims: 3\n   - Theater detection rate: 60.0%\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe demonstration successfully shows both systems working on real code analysis data.\nTheater detection identified 3 out of 5 claims as suspicious,\ndemonstrating the practical value of quality claim validation in preventing false\nimprovement reports.\n",
