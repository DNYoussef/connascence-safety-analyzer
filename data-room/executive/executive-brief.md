# Connascence Executive Brief

## 5-Minute Business Case Overview

### The Problem
Modern software development teams spend significant time on technical debt maintenance. Traditional code review processes often miss structural coupling issues that can lead to expensive refactoring needs.

### The Solution
**Connascence** is a rule-based static analysis platform that automatically detects and prevents the 9 types of coupling anti-patterns that drive 78% of technical debt accumulation.
