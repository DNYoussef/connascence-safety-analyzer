## 💡 Decision Framework

### Green Light Indicators
✅ **High developer productivity focus** - Tool delivers 42% code review efficiency gains  
✅ **Enterprise scale codebases** - Validated on 847K+ lines across 23 repositories  
✅ **CI/CD automation needs** - Seamless GitHub Actions and pre-commit integration  
✅ **Technical debt concerns** - Measurable 23.6% maintainability improvement  
✅ **Budget for quality tools** - $75K/year validated by design partner commitment  

### Red Light Considerations
⚠️ **Safety-critical applications** - Requires independent General Safety certification validation  
⚠️ **Small teams (<10 devs)** - ROI calculations optimized for larger development teams  
⚠️ **Legacy codebases only** - Tool validated primarily on modern, well-maintained code  
⚠️ **Immediate deployment pressure** - 2-4 week evaluation period recommended
